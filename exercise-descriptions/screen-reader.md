# Exercise 1: Using screen readers

Please mind! When it works whel with the NVDA screen reader, that doesn't mean it will work well with Voiceover or other screen readers and vice versa.

We are going to navigate to the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) website using a screen reader to understand the experience of visually impaired users.

## Steps
1. **Install a screen reader:**
   - **Windows:** Install NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) from [https://www.nvaccess.org/download/](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/).
   - **macOS:** Use the built-in VoiceOver (press Command + F5 to activate).

2. **Visit the W3C WAI website:**
   - Go to [W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) - WAI Website](https://www.w3.org/WAI/).
   - Try this one too: [EAA](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0882)

3. **Navigate:**
   - Use the tab key and arrow keys to move through the site and listen to how the screen reader interprets the content.
   - Use capslock + right arrow to step over all the items on the site with Voiceover
   - Find out and try out more shortcuts! (ctrl+option+h for Voiceover)
